# üö® Airport Drug Smuggler Detection Model

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL DISCLAIMER**
This is a **research and educational prototype** demonstrating machine learning applications in security contexts. This model is **NOT intended for production use** and contains significant ethical concerns that must be addressed before any real-world application.

## üìñ Project Overview

### For Non-Technical People: What Is This?
This project shows how artificial intelligence (AI) could theoretically predict if airport travelers are drug smugglers by analyzing their personal information and behavior. **BUT** - and this is crucial - it also demonstrates why this is a terrible idea that could lead to discrimination and violations of civil rights.

Think of it like this: We built a "digital profiling system" to show exactly why digital profiling systems are dangerous and unethical.

### üöÄ Quick Start (For Beginners)
1. **Download** all the project files to your computer

7. **Read** the bias warnings it prints out - this is the most important part!

### For Technical People: The Details
This proof-of-concept binary classification model assesses whether a traveler is likely to be a drug smuggler based on observable, non-invasive metadata. The project serves as an exploration of:

- **Machine learning in sensitive domains**

## ü§ñ Models Implemented

1. **Logistic Regression**: For interpretability and transparency
2. **Random Forest**: For feature importance and performance
3. **Weighted Logistic Regression**: Alternative approach to class imbalance

### Class Imbalance Handling
- **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- **Class weighting** strategies
- **Stratified sampling** for train/test splits

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

Given the **class imbalance** in smuggling detection, we focus on:
- **Precision**: Accuracy of positive predictions
- **Recall**: Ability to find all smugglers
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC-AUC**: Overall discriminative ability
- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed error analysis

*Note: Accuracy is de-emphasized due to class imbalance.*

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations & Bias Analysis

### üö® Major Ethical Concerns

#### 1. **Nationality Bias**
- Model uses `origin_country` as a predictor
- **Risk**: Systematic discrimination against specific nationalities
- **Impact**: Reinforces existing profiling practices

#### 2. **Behavioral Subjectivity**
- Relies on subjective behavioral assessments
- **Risk**: Officer bias in behavioral observations
- **Impact**: Cultural differences misinterpreted as suspicious behavior

#### 3. **Demographic Profiling**
- Age, gender, and employment status as risk factors
- **Risk**: Systematic bias against demographic groups
- **Impact**: Discriminatory treatment based on protected characteristics

#### 4. **False Positive Impact**
- Innocent travelers flagged as high-risk
- **Risk**: Unnecessary searches, missed flights, psychological trauma
- **Impact**: Erosion of civil liberties and travel experience

### üõ°Ô∏è Recommended Safeguards

1. **Human Oversight**: Never use as sole determinant for security decisions
2. **Appeals Process**: Clear mechanism for challenging algorithmic decisions  
3. **Bias Auditing**: Regular evaluation for discriminatory patterns
4. **Diverse Training**: Ensure representative datasets across all groups
5. **Feature Review**: Consider removing or reducing demographic predictors
6. **Transparency**: Clear communication about algorithmic assistance tools

## üìä Technical Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing
- **One-hot encoding** for categorical variables
- **Standard scaling** for numerical features
- **Binary conversion** of yes/no responses
- **Feature engineering** for behavioral indicators

### Model Training
- **80/20 train-test split** with stratification
- **Cross-validation** for model selection
- **Hyperparameter tuning** for optimal performance
- **Class imbalance handling** via SMOTE and weighting

### Feature Importance Analysis
- **Random Forest** importance scores
- **Logistic Regression** coefficient analysis
- **Top risk factor** identification
- **Correlation analysis** of behavioral indicators

## üîç Key Findings (Based on Analysis Results)

### Actual Top Risk Factors Identified
1. **Previous visits to hotspots** (21.9% importance)
2. **Flight duration** (21.5% importance)  
3. **Avoids customs** (13.3% importance)
4. **Nervous behavior** (11.8% importance)
5. **Inconsistent story** (8.3% importance)
6. **One-way ticket** (7.9% importance)
7. **Paid with cash** (4.0% importance)
8. **Unfamiliar with luggage** (3.7% importance)

### Bias Patterns Detected
- **Nigeria**: 30.6% smuggler rate (highest nationality bias)
- **Brazil**: 22.9% smuggler rate  
- **USA**: 22.6% smuggler rate
- **Behavioral patterns**: 69% of smugglers show "nervous behavior" vs 0% non-smugglers (indicates synthetic data issues)

### Model Performance Results
- **Perfect AUC scores** (1.0000) across all models
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This indicates synthetic data with unrealistic patterns
- **Real-world performance** would likely be much lower (0.75-0.85 range)
- **Zero false positives** in test set (unrealistic for production scenarios)
